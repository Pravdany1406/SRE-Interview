# Coding Challenge: Site Reliability Engineers  
Hello,
Thank you for taking the time to face this coding challenge. It should take you approximately one hour to complete it. Please use either Go or Python.  
Good luck!  

## Background  
Colors come in many different formats; as engineers the most common ones are RGB and HEX.  
RGB represents colors in three numbers: red, green and blue. Each of these are in represented in 16bit. Therefore pure red would be represented as RGB(255, 0, 0).
HEX represents colors in these three numbers too, but in hexadecimal format prefixed with a hash. Therefore pure red would be #FF0000.  

## Task
Write a simple application exposing an endpoint that takes a HEX color and returns its RGB representation.  
The majority of your time should be invested in ensuring that the server can be deployed into a highly monitored containerized system. This includes:  

- Ensuring scalability  
- Speed & space optimized containerization  
- Metrics coverage over what you deem important in a monitoring system  

Please include a README in the repository outlining how to build, run and check if your application works. Adding some explanation on choices you have made throughout will help our understanding further.

## Delivery  
Please provide the result in a bundled git repository with the full commit history included and send it to aline@freighthub.com once you're done.
