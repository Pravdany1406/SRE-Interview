# SRE Interview

The interview will be conducted by 1 engineer from the engineering Department (in English) and will last approximately 30-45 minutes.  

_Please note that the outcome of the interview can be negatively influenced by background noise and/or bad phone lines._

This interview is focused on coding. During the interview you will be asked questions about your technical skills including algorithms, data structures.

### IMPORTANT: In addition to this, please do plenty of preparation for this stage

* Invest time in preparing: It's important for any Engineer, even Senior ones, to brush up on their interview & communication approach, coding skills and Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures, algorithms, and time/space complexities. An interview is likely to be very different from your day-to-day job and is likely to present puzzles & challenges that you donâ€™t face frequently. With this in mind, we advise to prepare in the following ways: -

* Practice answering many different coding questions: It's better to have non-optimal but working code than just an idea. Once you have a working solution, you can then try to improve its efficiency, code design or any other aspect of it.

* Practice answering a coding question with the most efficient bug-free solution without using a compiler.

* Write code in a simple text editor: In the interview you will write your code in a similar environment (like CoderPad) without syntax highlighting or auto-completion.

* Practice by coding by hand: Practice some of the questions with a whiteboard or pen and paper to help prepare.

* Practice under time pressure: You will have a limited time for the coding question, so it will be important to finish it in time. If possible, have a mock interview with a friend to simulate the interview experience.

* Go over data structures, algorithms and complexity: Be able to discuss space and time complexity ( the big-O complexity of your approaches) Don't forget to brush up on your data structures like lists, arrays, hash tables, hash maps, stacks, queues, graphs, tries, heaps etc. Also sorts, searches, and traversals (BFS, DFS). Also review recursion and iterative approaches.

### IMPORTANT: Tips for the Coding Interview

* Ask clarification questions before you start coding: - you will need to qualify the problems presented in order to achieve a workable solution in a time-efficient manner. There will also be an opportunity to ask questions at the end of the interview that are unrelated to clarifying the coding challenge.

* Do not rush or overcomplicate things: Don't jump too quickly into the first solution that comes in mind... if you can't find a better solution in a reasonable time, start writing a working solution, then iterate and improve it as you go. It's better to have non-optimal but working code than just an idea. Once you have a working solution, you can then try to improve its efficiency, code design or any other aspect of it.

* Think out loud and explain your logic & reasoning in your work: We pay a lot of attention to the way you solve problems, which can be as important as having the right answer. Thinking out loud gives the interviewer insight into your thinking process and can also help them follow along with your solution. Moreover, it allows them to give hints when needed.

* Speak clearly: Ensure you are speaking clearly and likewise, if you can't hear the interviewer clearly, let them know so they can accommodate! You don't want to waste the whole interview trying to understand each other.

* Locate a quiet interview spot where you are not going to be disturbed: Choose a quiet place and ensure that you have good Internet connection and strong phone reception. Headphones will help with having your both hands free for coding.

* Use the programming language you're best at: It's important to write your solution correctly and in time, so use the language you are most familiar with.

* Share your reasoning: Make sure you can explain your reasoning for your solution(s); you will likely be asked about this. Engineering is all about tradeoffs, so be prepared to discuss them and demonstrate flexibility where necessary.

* Find and fix the bugs by yourself: Don't wait for the interviewer to find them for you.

* Use the hints you are given: Usually, the interviewer knows the question well enough to know which hints will help you next if you get stuck.
